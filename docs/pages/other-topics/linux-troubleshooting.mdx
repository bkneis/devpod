This purpose of this page is to outline any known issues with using devpod on Linux and provide known workarounds / fixes.

### Using FISH shell

Custom configurations in config.fish file run every time a fish -c command is called, so this processes somewhat get on the way of devpod agent workspace up.

The solution is to move the customizations inside the if status is-interactive case.

From this

```
if status is-interactive
    # Commands to run in interactive sessions can go here
end
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# customizations
```

to this

```
if status is-interactive
    # Commands to run in interactive sessions can go here
    eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
    
    # customizations
end
```
