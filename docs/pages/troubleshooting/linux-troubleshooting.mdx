This purpose of this page is to outline any known issues with using devpod on Linux and provide known workarounds / fixes.

### Using FISH shell

Custom configurations in config.fish file run every time a fish -c command is called, so this processes somewhat get on the way of devpod agent workspace up.

The solution is to move the customizations inside the if status is-interactive case.

From this

```
if status is-interactive
    # Commands to run in interactive sessions can go here
end
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# customizations
```

to this

```
if status is-interactive
    # Commands to run in interactive sessions can go here
    eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
    
    # customizations
end
```

### Using SELinux

If you are running SELinux and try to start a workspace with a mounted volume, you may recieve a "Permission Denied" even if the ownership of the files are correct. To resolve
append `:Z` to your volume definitions, like so

```
{
    // some fields

    "workspaceMount": "",
    "workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}",
    "runArgs": [
        // other args
        "--volume=${localWorkspaceFolder}:/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}:Z"
    ]
}
```
